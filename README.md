# zqding_whisper_datasets
This CSTR NAM TIMIT Plus corpus includes a parallel whispered speech recorded simultaneously via a non-audible murmur (NAM) microphone which uses urethane-elastomer 
to create a close contact with the skin and an omni-directional headset-mounted condenser microphone (a DPA 4035).

In the zqding_whisper_datasets, all silent segments are trimmed and each file is a 30-second speech clip.
